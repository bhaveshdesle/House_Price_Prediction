# House Price Prediction Web Application

## Project Description
This is a **Django-based web application** designed to predict house prices based on various input features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area (in square feet), location, and condition. The application uses a **machine learning model** that has been trained using an open-source housing price dataset. The model predicts house prices by processing the input features and outputting a predicted value.

### Features:
- Predict house prices based on user input.
- A simple form to input house features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, etc.
- The machine learning model is trained using a dataset and predicts the price for a given set of features.
